In my first semester as a USC student, I quickly realized that splitting cabs to and from the airport is almost a rite of passage. Whether it’s wearing USC merch to get recognized by other students or posting on Snapchat stories, GroupMe, and Slack channels, finding someone to share a cab with is practically a necessity thanks to LA’s notoriously high cab prices.

Sure, shared Lyfts and Ubers exist, but let’s be honest—no one wants to waste precious time sitting through inefficient detours just because Lyft’s algorithm decides to add stops that aren’t even on the way. And in LA traffic? That’s a hard pass.

That’s why I decided to build **USCabs**.

This app is designed to help USC students plan ahead—find a group to split a cab with, coordinate ride times, and head to the airport with fellow Trojans. Along the way, you might even meet some new people and make friends on campus.

As a transfer student myself, I know how hard it can be to connect with others, so I wanted this app to offer a little extra: a way to meet other students in a casual, practical setting. Because who knows? A shared cab ride could turn into a shared campus experience.
